* DELIGHTFUL-BITES! is a restaurant app that takes down user input for the names of burgers, and desserts they'd like to order.

* On the Food menu, whenever a user submits an order for a Meal Item, the Meal displays on the center of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each Meal Item in the waiting zone also has a `Devour!` button. When the user "Devours" the Meal Item, the Item will move to the right side of the page into the Devoured section, also triggering the MySql database to store the "Devoured" information.

* The app syncs every single Meal Item with a MySql database, and keeps track of Meal Item devoured status.
